## About myself

Hello! There :raising_hand: , my name is **Mudit**. I am a student going to join college this year. I have been learning to code :computer: since **November 2020 with python** :snake: as the first language. Currently, I am focusing on **web development** with the **MERN** tech stack and discovering **open source** and different opportunities to explore more domains in software development. Feel free to look at my profile and reach out to me.
